  # LiveKit Server (Local Development)
  # ============================================
  # ⚠️  WARNING: On macOS, use native installation instead of Docker!
  #
  # According to official LiveKit docs (https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/deployment/):
  #   "WebRTC servers can be tricky to deploy because of their use of UDP ports
  #    and having to know their own public IP address."
  #   "If running in a Dockerized environment, host networking should be used."
  #
  # macOS requires Docker Desktop 4.34+ with explicit host networking enablement,
  # and known issues remain (https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/7448).
  # This causes WebRTC peer connections to fail with "could not establish pc connection".
  #
  # Recommended: Install and run LiveKit natively:
  #   brew install livekit
  #   livekit-server --dev
  #
  # This Docker service is kept for Linux environments or reference only.
